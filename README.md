Setup a local development environment
-------------------------------------

The website is created using a static website generator called
[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/). Here's what you need to do to get a
copy of the website running on your local machine.

- Optional: have ``rbenv`` or ``rvm`` installed. These tools will automatically
  select the correct version of ruby based on the ``.ruby-version`` file in
  our project root. Alternatively you can use any system Ruby that is > 2.3.
- ``gem install bundler -v 1.17.3``
- ``bundle _1.17.3_ install``
- ``rbenv rehash`` only if using ``rbenv``
- ``[bundle exec] middleman server``
- See the website running at: http://localhost:4567/
