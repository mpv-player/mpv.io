Setup a local development environment
-------------------------------------

The website is created using a static website generator called
[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/). Here's what you need to do to get a
copy of the website running on your local machine.

- Strongly recommended: have ``rbenv`` or ``rvm`` installed. These tools will automatically
  select the correct version of Ruby based on the ``.ruby-version`` file.
  Alternatively you will need to install Ruby 3.x manually.
- ``gem install bundler``
- ``bundle install``
- ``bundle exec middleman server``
